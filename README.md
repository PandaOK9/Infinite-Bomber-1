# Infinite Bomber

### !!! Very big updates !!!

    Attention we have released version 2.0
    It has a lot of improvements and fixes
    
    Update. Version 2.0.0

    Shoveled system with the addition of services.   
    Now they are much easier to add, remove, modify.    
    All services are stored in the services file.yaml.    
    In fact, now anyone who knows anything about CSRF can do it.   
  
    Removed broken services and added new ones.   
    (For now, in the services file.yaml, 207).    
    Now the tor is initialized not immediately after the start of the program, but before the immediate beginning of the flood.    
    More versions of the program for different architectures appeared in the builds/android folder.
